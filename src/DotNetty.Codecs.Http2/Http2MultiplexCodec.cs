    /// <summary>
    /// An HTTP/2 handler that creates child channels for each stream.
    ///
    /// <para>When a new stream is created, a new <see cref="IChannel"/> is created for it. Applications send and
    /// receive <see cref="IHttp2StreamFrame"/>s on the created channel. <see cref="IByteBuffer"/>s cannot be processed by the channel;
    /// all writes that reach the head of the pipeline must be an instance of <see cref="IHttp2StreamFrame"/>. Writes that reach
    /// the head of the pipeline are processed directly by this handler and cannot be intercepted.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>The child channel will be notified of user events that impact the stream, such as <see
    /// cref="IHttp2GoAwayFrame"/> and <see cref="IHttp2ResetFrame"/>, as soon as they occur. Although <see
    /// cref="IHttp2GoAwayFrame"/> and <see cref="IHttp2ResetFrame"/> signify that the remote is ignoring further
    /// communication, closing of the channel is delayed until any inbound queue is drained with <see
    /// cref="IChannel.Read()"/>, which follows the default behavior of channels in Netty. Applications are
    /// free to close the channel in response to such events if they don't have use for any queued
    /// messages. Any connection level events like <see cref="IHttp2SettingsFrame"/> and <see cref="IHttp2GoAwayFrame"/>
    /// will be processed internally and also propagated down the pipeline for other handlers to act on.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>Outbound streams are supported via the <see cref="Http2StreamChannelBootstrap"/>.</para>
    ///
    /// <para><see cref="IChannelConfiguration.MaxMessagesPerRead"/> and <see cref="IChannelConfiguration.IsAutoRead"/> are supported.</para>
    ///
    /// <h3>Reference Counting</h3>
    ///
    /// <para>Some <see cref="IHttp2StreamFrame"/>s implement the <see cref="IReferenceCounted"/> interface, as they carry
    /// reference counted objects (e.g. <see cref="IByteBuffer"/>s). The multiplex codec will call <see cref="IReferenceCounted.Retain()"/>
    /// before propagating a reference counted object through the pipeline, and thus an application handler needs to release
    /// such an object after having consumed it. For more information on reference counting take a look at
    /// https://netty.io/wiki/reference-counted-objects.html </para>
    ///
    /// <h3>Channel Events</h3>
    ///
    /// <para>A child channel becomes active as soon as it is registered to an <see cref="IEventLoop"/>. Therefore, an active channel
    /// does not map to an active HTTP/2 stream immediately. Only once a <see cref="IHttp2HeadersFrame"/> has been successfully sent
    /// or received, does the channel map to an active HTTP/2 stream. In case it is not possible to open a new HTTP/2 stream
    /// (i.e. due to the maximum number of active streams being exceeded), the child channel receives an exception
    /// indicating the cause and is closed immediately thereafter.</para>
    ///
    /// <h3>Writability and Flow Control</h3>
    ///
    /// <para>A child channel observes outbound/remote flow control via the channel's writability. A channel only becomes writable
    /// when it maps to an active HTTP/2 stream and the stream's flow control window is greater than zero. A child channel
    /// does not know about the connection-level flow control window. <see cref="IChannelHandler"/>s are free to ignore the
    /// channel's writability, in which case the excessive writes will be buffered by the parent channel. It's important to
    /// note that only <see cref="IHttp2DataFrame"/>s are subject to HTTP/2 flow control.</para>
    ///
    /// @deprecated use <see cref="Http2FrameCodecBuilder"/> together with <see cref="Http2MultiplexHandler"/>.
